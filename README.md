Introduction

Our web application is intended to assist an Animal Rescue with the tasks of rescuing homeless or abused animals and providing them quality homes. This is done by providing a web location where concerned citizens can report animals who need help. Also, the employees of the Animal Rescue can post photos and profiles of animals who need homes to the public. By doing so, the Rescue can be more effective by utilizing the publicâ€™s assistance in locating animals in need and in turn the public can be aware of animals that are available for adoption.
    
In addition, the web application also allows individuals to apply to be volunteers or foster parents. Once accepted as a volunteer, the volunteer can log in to schedule their availability. The Animal Rescue employees can also advertise supplies needed for the shelter such as food and bedding that the public can donate.
